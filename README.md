# Miguelo's Rust CLI

Small project to create a cli program with a set of options to run a set of silly algorithms.
This code has the sole purpose of getting my hands dirty with Rust's special features like traits or lifetimes.

### Options

When you run the program you get a set of options:

- A calculator
- A string analysis and manipulation program
- A fibonacci number printer
- The fizz buzz problem
